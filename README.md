based on the childhood favorite "smash a mole" that is a more animal friendly version where we feed them instead

The game has all the common arcade features such as: progressive levels difficulty, win conditions, lose conditions, score, sounds, bonuses etc..

It was a lot of fun building this project using vanilla HTML, CSS & JS without the aid of any framework

what I learned the most in this project was appreciating logic & scope dependencies in JS and how to solve problems by breaking them into smaller chunks and dealing with them one line at a time;

& how to employ requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval when dealing with hot code where real time performance could pose an issue

Most of the artwork was provided by the talented Alice Brereton

the rest of the visuals were edited by me using basic 3D paint editing software as well as some open source graphics sources that I found online
